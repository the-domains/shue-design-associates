SHUE Design Associates carefully considers the needs of each client and their project individually.  Whether the project is a new house, an addition or renovation, or a small outbuilding, our designs reflect the combined sensibilities of the client and our staff.  We seek to provide seamless integrations with each project's site, as if the project were always meant to look the way it does, where it is.  We also strive to produce designs that are authentic in terms of historical and local precedent.  Along the way, we build on that authenticity to make new and refreshing design decisions, which lead to a one-of-a-kind finished product.
